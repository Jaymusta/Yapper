# Have you ever wanted to play osu! with your voice? To yell the circles to the beat? 

## Well, now you can with Yapper!

### How it works:

Yapper constantly scans the sound volume levels coming from your microphone. When the set threshold is met or passed, it triggers Yapper to activate the configured keybinding.

By default, these values are set as follows:

Threshold = 50

Keybinding = z

Have fun!
