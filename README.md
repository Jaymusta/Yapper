# Have you ever wanted to play osu! with your voice? To yell the circles to the beat? 

## Well, now you can with Yapper!

### How it works:

Yapper constantly scans the volume levels coming from your microphone. When the set threshold is met or passed, Yapper activates the configured keybinding.

By default, these values are set as follows:

Threshold = 50

Keybinding = z

### How to change these values:

Press enter while Yapper is running to prompt the options to change your threshold and keybinding. (Threshold values range from 0.01-100)


# Have fun!
